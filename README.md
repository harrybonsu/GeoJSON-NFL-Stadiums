## NFL STADIUM LOCATIONS - GeoJSON of American Football Stadiums

![Stadium Map](images/MapScreenshot.png)

With geojson data retrieved from https://github.com/sisskind/GeoJSON-Football/blob/master/stadiums.geojson, we used the capababilities of Leaflet to create a map to show the locations of all current NFL stadiums. However, since the data was last updateed in 2017, a local copy was created and updated to reflect the current information on the teams as well as the stadiums. An image folder containing all the logos of the NFL teams was used to add team logos to the popups on the maps. Users will notice that teams which share stadiums such as L.A. Rams and L.A. Chargers (SoFi Stadium) and NY Jets and NY Giants (MetLife Stadium) have the logos of both teams in their respective popups. 

The map has three (3) base layers; Street, Dark and Satelite Map. With a collapsable control panel, users can pick which layer they want to view. The popups show important information on the team/teams that play there, Stadium name, Conference as well as the Team logo.
